## Picasso - Painting Robot
- Picasso is my project to build a painting robot.
- I am trying to build it in distinct, reusable components to facilitate different robot configurations / software.
- The core of this project is JCode - a really simple custom protocol used to send instructions to the robots.
  - It is very simple - mainly so its really easy to reimplement on the arduino side.
